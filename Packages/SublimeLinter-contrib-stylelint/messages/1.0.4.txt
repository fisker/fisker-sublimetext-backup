SublimeLinter-contrib-stylelint 1.0.4
--------------------------------------

Hi!

The plugin has been updated to use the stylelint CLI where available - old versions of stylelint are still supported!
Using the CLI should give a more predictable experience and more accurate line numbers than previously available. Sass/scss synax support has also been added (thanks fengnana).

Sorry it's taken a while to get around to these updates, I've been mega busy. 
Any plugin issues here - https://github.com/kungfusheep/SublimeLinter-contrib-stylelint/issues

Happy linting
