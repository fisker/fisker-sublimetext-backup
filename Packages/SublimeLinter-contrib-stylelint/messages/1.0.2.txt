SublimeLinter-contrib-stylelint 1.0.2
--------------------------------------

Hi!

In this update, the plug-in will now attempt to load the local install 
of postcss & stylelint from your project directory (your .stylelintrc
location) or one of its parent directories. So it's no longer necessary 
to have a separate install of either for the sake of this plug-in. 

Any issues here - https://github.com/kungfusheep/SublimeLinter-contrib-stylelint/issues

Happy linting
